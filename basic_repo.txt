I created a remote repository on GitHub then created a local repository.
After initializing those two I created a this text document describing my steps in the local repository.
To prepare my document for the 'staging area' I had git search for any changes to this document
by using the gid add command then I committed and left a message with the 'git commit -m' command.
Afterward, I pushed my changes up to the remote repository.
